    <h1>Popular Skydiving Disciplines</h1>
    <div id="discList">
      <h2>Most Common</h2>
      <p>
        If you think that skydiving is only a once-or-twice skyride strapped to
        a stranger, you have another thing coming. In actual fact, skydiving is
        very much a sport. Thousands of people around the world train, practice,
        perform and compete at the top level in the sport's several disciplines,
        all of which have very distinct features.

        <li>RW: Routine Work</li>
        <li>FF: Free Flying</li>
        <li>Wing Suit Flying</li>
        <li>Angle Flying</li>
        <li>Canopy Swooping</li>

    <h2>FREEFLY (FF)</h2>
    <p class="freeFly">
      Speaking of "refinement to a degree that seems almost physically
      impossible" --have you ever done a one-armed handstand on your friend's
      back when you jump out of a plane, then surfed him, done a coordinated
      frontflip and played a really complicated multi-orientational game of
      peek-a-boo before linking legs into a diamond that your camera-toting
      buddy flies through? These guys did. sYou can, too, if you work your
      everloving butt off in the freefly discipline.
    </p>

    <h2>ANGLE FLYING</h2>
    <p>
      Angle flying is the natural (read: harder, better, faster, stronger)
      evolution of the tracking discipline. Angle flying is the fastest,
      farthest and closest-to-your-friends method by which a human is able to
      fly through the sky without a wingsuit. It kinda looks like freeflying to
      the uninitiated--and, in truth, there are lots of crossover skills--but
      the goal here is to ZOOM.

    <h2>CANOPY PILOTING/SWOOPING</h2>
    <p>
      Couldn't be bothered with freefall? Have we ever got a discipline for you.
      You can get that canopy open as soon as you leave the plane and still have
      a whale of a time in the air. Parachutes designed for fancy tricks in the
      sky (and close to the ground) make for knuckle-biting viewing. It doesn't
      stop there, either: If you get the right nylon overhead and some friends
      together, you can get together and make pretty shapes in the sky.
